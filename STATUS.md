# STATUS - Tool-MaterialMaker-MCP

> ⚠️ **Super-alpha.** Built by an artist/animator (not a software engineer) with
> heavy AI help. "Verified" below means "worked on the one machine it was built
> on," not "battle-tested." Expect breakage. See the README warning.

Gate ledger. Three states only: ✅ verified · 🔌 wired · ⬜ not started.

_Last updated: 2026-09-11 (published companion and live recovery acceptance)._

**How to read this file (rule adopted 2026-09-05, teardown #3):** each cell holds
the state, one line of what it is, and a pointer to where the evidence lives
(a test file, a doc, a commit). Corrections, reversals, and session narrative
go in `HANDOFF.md`'s session log or `git log`, never into a cell. If a row
needs more than three lines to explain, the explanation belongs in a doc the
row points at.

## Current 0.8 alpha

| Component or gate | State | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shared service, build/export and portable authoring contracts | ✅ verified | 477 passed, 1 Windows-only skip; [companion evidence](docs/upgrade/evidence/workshop-companion-native.json). |
| MCP tool registration with the actual SDK | ✅ verified | SDK 2.2.0 registers all 42 documented tools; `tests/test_readme_counts.py`. |
| Native retry isolation and source-relative dependencies | ✅ verified | Focused subprocess/asset regressions; `tests/upgrade/test_render_reliability.py`. |
| Saved setup, repair and authenticated launch reuse | ✅ verified | [Launch evidence](docs/upgrade/evidence/workshop-launch-local.json) and setup/session regressions. |
| Visual library, variations, history and exact downloads | ✅ verified | 3 real HTTP/CSP browser cases and 21 Node state cases; [browser evidence](docs/upgrade/evidence/workshop-browser-local.json). |
| WebGL path and responsive viewport | ✅ verified | Chromium SwiftShader with labelled synthetic maps; [desktop/mobile captures](docs/upgrade/WORKSHOP.md). |
| Native worker cancellation | ✅ verified | Foundry cancellation reaches Workshop and drains the native worker while retaining the last good package; [live evidence](docs/upgrade/evidence/workshop-companion-live.json). |
| Successful native baking, source reopen and Godot imports | ✅ verified | Sand at 128 pixels with native source reopen/LOW-HIGH imports; 256-pixel live bake/Godot Web references; [native](docs/upgrade/evidence/workshop-companion-native.json), [live](docs/upgrade/evidence/workshop-companion-live.json). |
| Exact linked Foundry handoff and source refresh | ✅ verified | Browser and actual MCP clients preserve runtime/scene/images and reject stale source; [companion evidence](docs/upgrade/evidence/workshop-companion-native.json). |
| Hosted TLS deployment and startup recovery | ✅ verified | Clean published sources, TLS auth, LaunchAgent installation and automatic recovery; no reboot performed; [live evidence](docs/upgrade/evidence/workshop-companion-live.json). |
| Shared MCP queue and independent service recovery | ✅ verified | One native worker, exact Edit source link, targeted restart, child/manager crashes and preserved routes/workspaces; [live evidence](docs/upgrade/evidence/workshop-companion-live.json). |
| Native editor writes and bridge history | 🔌 wired | Disposable editor mutation checks remain; native writes disabled by default. |
| Packaged resources, wheel and metadata | ✅ verified | 109 resource files match, wheel and metadata checks pass; [integration record](docs/upgrade/INTEGRATION.md). |
| Integration branch CI | ✅ verified | Accepted Workshop `107534a`: all five Linux, Windows, macOS, distribution and browser jobs pass; [run 34579067693](https://github.com/waskosky/Tool-MaterialMaker-MCP/actions/runs/34579067693). |
| Alpha release publication | ⬜ not started | Version 0.8.0a1 remains a development candidate; release workflow disabled on the fork. |

Native acceptance covers one sand recipe at 128 and 256 pixels, without a broader
recipe or device matrix. Experimental native editor writes remain disabled and
need separate acceptance. The existing game root returned 502 before and after
deployment; the tools operate independently of the stopped game stack and RAI.

The following ledger records the **0.7 baseline's historical gates**, not a
certification of the changed 0.8 native paths. For current capability boundaries,
see [upgrade status](docs/upgrade/STATUS.md).

## Historical 0.7 phases
