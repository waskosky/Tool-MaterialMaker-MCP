    out -- cascading into every subsequent render hanging at the timeout
    (found 2026-08-29 while rendering debug swatches; recovered by taskkill-ing
    all Godot). taskkill's /T flag walks the live parent-PID tree from the

    launcher is still alive -- a dead (possibly recycled) PID kills nothing.

    Uses Popen + process.wait() (not subprocess.run) so a timeout can kill the
    whole process tree while the launcher is still alive -- subprocess.run
    kills only its direct child then re-raises, leaving Godot's spawned
    render/GUI grandchild orphaned to squat Material Maker's single-instance
    lock (see _kill_tree).

    Redirects Godot's stdout/stderr to temp FILES rather than pipes. Material
    Maker's export leaves a lingering child (its Steam/relaunch process) that
    inherits the launcher's output handles; a PIPE stays un-closed until that
    grandchild also exits, so communicate() -- which blocks on pipe EOF, not
    process exit -- kept every render hung to the full timeout despite the
    export finishing in seconds. A file has no EOF dependency: wait() returns
