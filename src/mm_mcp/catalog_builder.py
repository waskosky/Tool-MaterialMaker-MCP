    1. The widget carries its own range directly (a `named_parameter`-style
       widget with `min`/`max`/`step`/`default` fields right on it, no
       `linked_widgets` at all). Build the param dict straight from the

    2. The widget has `linked_widgets` pointing at an inner node that is
       itself an inline `shader`-type node (it carries its own embedded
       `shader_model`). Look up the matching shader parameter there and
       parse it the same way a leaf node's own parameters are parsed.
    3. The widget's linked inner node has no inline `shader_model` -- it is
       a plain type reference (e.g. `"type": "voronoi"` with no nested
       shader block of its own). Its real parameters live in the
       separately-parsed catalog entry for that type. When `full_catalog`

       resolved `parameters` list for a matching name.

    applied yet within the same round -- whether it has depends on
    `generic_raw_data`'s iteration order, which mirrors `glob.glob()`'s
    order, which the stdlib does not guarantee to be sorted or stable

    resolves once `fast_blur` has been reprocessed with the full catalog

    changes converges on the same fully-resolved catalog regardless of
