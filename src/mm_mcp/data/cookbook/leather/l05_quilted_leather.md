# l05_quilted_leather - Quilted or tufted leather

_Category: leather. Open the graph: `cookbook/leather/l05_quilted_leather.ptex`._

A saddle-tan grain base raised into a grid of puffy pads with recessed stitch-channel seams, the car-seat or chesterfield look.

## Recipe

Clones `crocodile_skin` for its base grain, but the quilt pads themselves come from the `pattern` node rather than the voronoi cells: two Sine waves multiplied (`x_wave`/`y_wave` = Sine, `mix` = Multiply, scale around 5) give a smooth grid of rounded pads that peak at the pad centers and fall to the seams, the quilt shape. Drive the normal from the pattern pads (`param1` around 0.9 for pronounced padding), with the crocodile grain blended on top as fine detail: the height blend weights the pads at 0.85 and the grain at 0.15 (`HeightComposite.amount=0.85`), so the puffy quilt shape dominates and the grain is a subtle overlay. Darken the seams in albedo with a seam mask off the same pattern so the channels read as recessed.

Pitfall specific to this material: the natural way to lay down stitch dashes is a small `shape` repeated by `tiler`, but that approach fought back badly. In the full graph it produced no visible dashes, and isolating the tiler output to the albedo timed out the renderer at 180 seconds (a single centered shape through `tiler` builds a degenerate or expensive shader in this setup). The reliable path was the parameter-only `pattern` node instead, with no shape or tiler shader surprises. Honest gap: this delivers the quilt shape and channel seams but not individual per-stitch dash marks running along the seams. l06 in this cookbook solves the dash generator that l05 lacks.

## Subgraph structure

Grouped per the "Grouping into subgraphs" lever in `docs/AUTHORING.md`. This
is one of the three materials in this category the blend-tracing caution is
about: it carries two `blend` nodes (`HeightComposite` for height,
`AlbedoComposite` for albedo). Their port sources were traced from the
serialized `connections` list assembled in the builder, against
`blend.mmg`'s own shader model (ground truth): input `s1` is port0
(foreground), `s2` is port1 (background), `a` is port2 (mask), output =
`mask*port0 + (1-mask)*port1`. Traced wiring:

- `HeightComposite`: port0 ← `QuiltLayout` (the quilt pads), port1 ←
  `GrainHeight` (grain height). Port2 (mask) has no connection at all, so it
  uses the node's own default of a constant `1.0`, making the opacity equal
  to `amount`. This is a flat, unmasked `amount*pads + (1-amount)*grain` mix,
  not a spatial composite. Height weighting fix (2026-09-04): `amount` was
  `0.35` (pads underweighted, grain dominant, so the busy high-frequency
  crocodile grain overpowered the smooth quilt pads in the normal). Now
  `0.85`, so the pads drive the relief with the grain as ~0.15 fine detail,
  matching the recipe's stated pad-driven intent; confirmed in a 3D preview
  (puffy padded bumps with recessed channels). The exposed "Quilt puffiness"
  slider IS this `amount`, so higher reads as puffier.
- `AlbedoComposite`: port0 (shown where mask=1) ← `SeamShade` (the dark
  constant, in the recessed seams); port1 (shown where mask=0) ←
  `LeatherColor` (base grain, on the pad faces); port2 (mask) ← `SeamMask`.

Polarity fix (2026-09-04): `SeamMask` is 1 for low `QuiltLayout` values (the
recessed seams) and 0 for high ones (the raised pad centers), and blend output
is `mask*port0 + (1-mask)*port1`, so the dark `SeamShade` must sit on port0
(shown where mask=1 = the seams) and the grain on port1 (shown where mask=0 =
the pads). The original wiring had these reversed, so the dark landed on the
pad centers as button-tuft dots rather than in the seams. A before/after
render confirmed the flip: grain-toned pads on dark recessed seams.

Honest geometry note: the two-multiplied-sine `pattern` makes compact, roughly
circular peaks with broad low valleys, so after the fix the grain pads read as
round pads on a broad dark seam grid rather than large puffy diamond pads with
thin seams. Grayson reviewed the before/after and chose the swap: it matches
the material's name and stated intent, with the round pad shape accepted as a
minor stylization. A proper broad-diamond quilt would need a different wave
shape (e.g. `pattern` Bounce) and is a separate, larger change.

Opening the graph shows 4 top-level groups (plus `Material` and the
untouched metallic `NonMetallic`) instead of the raw 11-node graph:

- **Leather Grain** — `PoreCells`, `LeatherColor`, `LeatherRoughness`, and
  `GrainHeight`. Unlike `l01`/`l03`/`l04`'s `_group_leather_grain` shape,
  `GrainHeight` sits here rather than in a separate finish group: this
  builder rewires `LeatherNormal`'s input away from `GrainHeight` and onto
  `HeightComposite`'s output, so `GrainHeight` no longer feeds
  `LeatherNormal` directly and instead only feeds the quilt composite below.
  Exposed: `Leather color` (`LeatherColor.gradient`), `Roughness`
  (`LeatherRoughness.gradient`).
- **Quilt Pattern** — `QuiltLayout` alone. Exposed: `Quilt pad size`
  (`QuiltLayout.x_scale`).
- **Seam Shading** — `SeamMask`, `SeamShade`. Exposed: `Seam color`
  (`SeamShade.gradient`). The mask's own threshold gradient is not
  exposed, matching this project's standing convention for threshold masks.
- **Quilt Composite** — `HeightComposite`, `AlbedoComposite`, and
  `LeatherNormal` together, since `LeatherNormal`'s only input is now
  `HeightComposite`'s output rather than a raw donor colorize. All of this
  group's external inputs come from **Leather Grain** (base albedo/height),
  **Quilt Pattern** (pad shape), and **Seam Shading** (mask/color) — the
  same all-external-inputs shape `f08_donegal_tweed`'s `fleck_composite`
  used. Exposed: `Quilt puffiness` (`HeightComposite.amount`), `Relief
  strength` (`LeatherNormal.param1`).

`group_into_subgraph` preserves each incoming connection's own target port
independently when rehoming it through `gen_inputs`, so grouping cannot swap
which source lands on port0 vs port1 vs port2. Verified after building:
`renders_match` against this material's own pre-retrofit baseline came back
at an exact `grid_mean_abs_diff` of `0.0` on all three exported maps.
