    matrix with visible gaps between them, not edge-to-edge packed. This is
    the softer, more organic sibling to s06_river_pebbles (which is a solid
    packed mosaic, no gaps) -- Grayson asked for something "softer, like
    river stone, maybe even pebbles" in place of the original concrete
    recipe here. (Concrete's approach -- CLONE `rock`, crush voronoi_0 to
    scale 2 for soft unpatterned staining -- is preserved in AUTHORING.md's
    session history if a poured-concrete recipe is wanted again later; this
    slot is now stones-in-sand, not concrete.)

    CLONE `rock` again, but instead of blending two fields together for a
    flat mottled look (the concrete approach) or filling the whole frame
    with stone cells (s06), THRESHOLD voronoi_0's own distance field
    (port 0, high at cell centers, low near cell borders) into a hard mask:
    high = stone, low = sand gap. Stone albedo comes from voronoi_0's
    per-cell random output (port 2) through a pale, low-contrast natural
    gradient -- softer/lighter than s06's darker slate-to-brown spread, per
    "softer." Sand fills the gaps with perlin-driven warm tan variation.
    Normal relief kept gentle (`param1` ~0.35, lower than s06's 0.6) for
    smooth, water-worn stones rather than s06's more pronounced bulge.

    2026-09-14 normal/albedo alignment fix (mirrors s02 granite / s06): the

    field rock's donor already routed to its normal chain) instead of a
    separate voronoi_1/perlin_1/warp_0 relief chain. Material Maker seeds
    voronoi from node position, so two voronoi nodes never share a cell layout
    even at matching scale -- the old chain bumped nowhere near the stones.
    Switching the generator (not the port/polarity) keeps the rounded bulge
    but now on the same cells the mask carves into stone-vs-sand. Look note:
    dropping warp_0 makes the stone silhouettes cleanly voronoi-geometric (the

    """Natural river stones / pebbles: rounded, tightly-packed smooth stones
    in varied natural tones, the organic counterpart to s05's regular hex
    tile. CLONE `rock` (same donor as s02 granite -- it already has a voronoi
    albedo chain), but tune for BIG rounded cells instead of granite's fine
    flecks:

    - voronoi_0 scale dropped to ~7 (big pebble-sized cells, vs granite's 40+
      fine flecks). A voronoi distance field bulges high at cell centers and
      drops to a crevice at borders, so at this scale each cell reads as one
      rounded stone with a dark gap around it.
    - albedo fed from voronoi_0 PORT 2 (rand3 per-cell random) through a
      multi-tone natural-stone gradient, so each pebble is a genuinely
      different tone (gray, tan, brown, slate) rather than one flat color --
      the same per-cell-random lever s02 granite v2 and s05 hex tile use.
    - normal fed from the SAME voronoi_0 (port 1, the `.w` distance field that
      rock's donor already routed to its normal chain), so the relief bulge
      lands on the very cells the albedo colors instead of a disjoint second
      voronoi. This is the 2026-09-14 normal/albedo alignment fix (mirrors the
      s02 granite root-cause fix): because Material Maker seeds voronoi from
      node position, two different voronoi nodes never share a cell layout
      even at matching scale, so the old separate voronoi_1/perlin_1/warp_0
      relief chain bumped nowhere near the pebble colors. Switching the
      generator (not the port or polarity) keeps rock's proven rounded-bulge
      relief but now co-located with the color. param1 ~0.6 / param4=0 for a
      pronounced directly-fed analytic bulge (controller-tunable).
    - a fine perlin grain multiplied over albedo for per-stone surface
      texture, same detail lever added to s05 after Grayson's "needs another
      level of detail" note -- a smooth pebble still has fine mineral grain.
    Non-metal, moderate roughness (wet-looking river stone is a touch
    glossier than dry fieldstone, kept mid-range).

    Look note: dropping warp_0 makes the pebble silhouettes cleanly
    voronoi-geometric -- the water-worn organic edge distortion the separate
    warped relief used to add is gone; re-add a voronoi_0-fed warp if a softer
    edge is wanted."""

    # which peaks along each cell's medial axis -> a sharp crease that reads
    # faceted). Reversed ramp: centers (low port0) -> high ground, borders (high
    # port0) -> recessed seam. This is the Grayson-approved _dome_the_cells
    # recipe from the leather cookbook. The old separate voronoi_1/perlin_1/
    # warp_0 relief chain is dead -- drop its connections and remove it.
    # CONVEX dome profile (h ~= sqrt(1-(r/0.618)^2), a spherical cap): FLAT at
    # the apex (low port0) so the normal points straight up at the top, then
    # steepening toward the seam. A straight ramp would make port0's LINEAR
    # distance field a CONE -- constant slope to a singular point at the tip
    # (the "point in the middle" Grayson caught). Holding the top flat rounds it.
    # Smooth ANALYTIC dome via a single math node, NOT a stepped colorize: a
    # colorize gradient has a control point at every stop, and the analytic
    # normal (param4=0) turns each into a concentric contour RING on the
    # near-flat apex (the "banding" Grayson caught). cos(port0*B) is one smooth

    # (A=0, apex) curving to ~0 at the border (A~0.6, B=2.6 -> cos(~1.57)~0 =

    irregularity beehive's perfectly-regular hex grid could never produce.
    dry_earth is already the proven donor for s03 cracked concrete (a flat
    recolor); here we go further and give each plate its own stone tone so the
    plates read as separate cobbles, not one cracked slab.

    Levers:
    - voronoi_0 scale 4 -> 6: dry_earth's default plates are paving-slab huge;
      6 makes cobble-sized stones (still irregular, the whole point).
    - per-cobble tone: feed voronoi_0 PORT 2 (rand3, per-cell random -- the
      same lever s02 granite v2 / s05 / s06 use) into a multi-tone stone
      gradient, then REWIRE it in as blend_0's base (port 1) in place of the
      flat perlin earth. Each plate now gets a different gray/tan/brown/slate
      tone.
    - the existing warped-crack Multiply overlay (blend_0 port 0, unchanged)
      still darkens the inter-plate cracks -- now reading as recessed mortar
      shadow between cobbles. blend_0 amount 0.4 -> 0.6 for deeper, more
      clearly recessed mortar lines than dry_earth's subtle staining.
    - fine perlin grain multiplied over the albedo (the s05/s06 detail lever,
      no mask so the unconnected opacity port is a uniform 1.0) so each cobble
      shows real surface grain, not a flat per-plate tone.
    Relief (dry_earth's crack->height->normal chain) is kept as-is: worn
    cobbles have flat-ish tops and deep mortar gaps, which is what this chain
    already produces. Non-metal: dry_earth has no metallic input connected."""

def build_s13_polished_marble(catalog: dict) -> str:
    """Polished Carrara-style marble, MOVED IN from the terrain category
    (was `t09_marbled_silt`, quality/cookbook_terrain.py). Grayson's verdict
    on that material's render: the fbm-turbulence swirl reads as marble, so
    embrace it -- keep the exact same base (`crocodile_skin` donor, `voronoi_0`
    retyped to `fbm` with a Perlin+folds turbulence basis) and rework it into
    a proper polished stone: classic white/gray Carrara palette, low glossy
    roughness, zero metallic, and a near-flat relief, instead of terrain's
    warm tan/sand "dried mineral wash" read.

    This is deliberately a DIFFERENT technique from `s11_marble` (which warps
    `dry_earth`'s voronoi crack network hard, per that builder's docstring,
    "the flow IS the look"). s11's veins come from a distance-field crack
    network pushed through heavy warp; s13's veins come from a folded fbm
    turbulence field with no voronoi cells anywhere in the graph. Keeping
    both gives the stone category two structurally distinct marble recipes,
    which is the point of preserving this fbm-turbulence proof rather than
    discarding it once the terrain slot moved on.

    Changes from `t09_marbled_silt`, all pointed at "polished stone" rather
    than "dry ground":

    - **Vein-retune fix (this pass)**: Grayson's verdict on the first stone
      render was TERRAZZO/speckled granite, not flowing Carrara veins. Root
      cause 1: `scale_x`/`scale_y` at 3 still made many small folded features
      per unit surface, not a handful of large meandering ones -- dropped to
      1.8 (a smaller MM scale number means larger features) so only a few
      major ridges span the sphere. `folds` bumped 2 -> 3 to make the fold
      geometry itself meander more (a different lever from feature count),
      while `iterations` dropped 5 -> 4 to hold fine-octave graininess down
      rather than let the extra fold complexity reintroduce speckle.
      Root cause 2: the albedo gradient's dark/transition region ate roughly
      56% of the fbm value range (0.0-0.28 and 0.72-1.0), so a wide swath of
      the field rendered as some shade of gray, reading as many small dark
      flecks instead of a few thin lines. Narrowed the vein-plus-transition
      band to 12% on each end (0.0-0.12, 0.88-1.0) and widened the near-white
      plateau to 76% of the range (0.12-0.88) so only the sparse fold
      extremes go dark.
    - Palette: classic white/gray Carrara, not t09's warm tan/rust. Base
      plateau near-white (~0.86-0.90) now spans the wide 0.12-0.88 middle of
      the gradient, with the vein core a charcoal grey (~0.16-0.17, darker
      than the prior cool-gray 0.32-0.35 so the thin lines read as crisp dark
      strokes) confined to a narrow band at each extreme (0.0-0.05, 0.95-1.0)
      with a short transition (0.05-0.12, 0.88-0.95) -- not a 50/50 split,
      which is what made the prior warm-toned pass at this shape read as burl
      wood rather than stone, and not the too-broad transition that made the
      first Carrara pass read as terrazzo.
    - Roughness: `MarbleRoughness` now reads the SAME raw fbm field as the
      albedo (this donor's shape feeds `colorize_0`/`colorize_1`/`colorize_3`
      all straight from `voronoi_0` port 0, so no rewiring is needed), with a
      narrow polished-marble band (0.20 field / 0.30 at the vein bands) in
      place of t09's flat near-white matte ramp -- a genuine roughness
      TEXTURE, not a bare scalar, so an ORM map still exports; the veins read
      a touch rougher than the polished field, matching real ground-and-
      polished stone where the veins take the polish slightly differently.
      Its gradient breakpoints (0.05/0.12/0.88/0.95) mirror the retuned
      albedo gradient's so the rougher band lines up with the vein band.
    - Metallic: `NonMetallic` (`uniform_0`) left at its untouched 0 -- marble
      is a dielectric, verified via the ORM metallic channel approach if a
      render is taken.
    - Relief: `MarbleNormal`'s `param1` dropped 0.25 -> 0.08 (`param4=0`
      unchanged, the standing flat-normal fix) -- polished marble is nearly
      flat, so the veins should be the faintest whisper of relief, not
      terrain's gentle swell."""

def build_s12_eroded_sandstone(catalog: dict) -> str:
    """Water-eroded sandstone: horizontal sediment strata smeared into
    diagonal erosion runs, built FROM SCRATCH (no donor -- nothing else in
    the cookbook has this topology, and it needs its own).

    **Why `directional_warp`, not `slope_blur`.** The phase plan originally
    named `slope_blur` for this recipe. `slope_blur.mmg` is a compound graph
    built entirely from two `buffer` nodes sandwiching an `edge_detect`
    shader (`buffer -> edge_detect_3_3_2 -> buffer_2`, no unbuffered
    bypass), and `buffer` nodes compile a compute shader at load time --
    this project's headless `--export-material` pipeline cannot drive that
    (see `build_swatch_slope_blur`'s docstring in `quality/debug_swatches.py`
    for the proof: valid graph, all-black render). `directional_warp` has no
    such trap -- it is a plain per-pixel UV offset by a constant
    `angle`/`strength` (no map inputs needed, verified with `describe_node`
    and pixel-checked in `build_swatch_directional_warp`) -- and its
    displacement behavior is exactly the "smear a layered field along a
    constant direction" effect real water erosion needs, so it is a better
    fit for this material, not just a workaround.

    **Banded sediment base -- restored to distinct, legible strata (round
    2 fix, see below).** `SedimentNoise` is a `perlin` with `scale_x=4` (low
    -- few large horizontal-ish features) and `scale_y=14` (high again --
    more, thinner, clearly separated bands; raised back up from the
    de-wood pass's 9, which had softened the strata into a mottle), 3
    iterations and `persistence=0.62`. `SedimentBands` colorizes it through
    a 10-stop palette built as five flat COLOR PLATEAUS joined by soft
    (~0.08-wide) transitions -- pale buff / pale tan / muted rust / light
    warm grey / pale sandy highlight -- instead of a hard step or a fully
    smooth ramp, so each stratum still reads as a distinct band but fades
    gradually into its neighbor (round 3 fix, see below). Still
    lower-saturation/higher-value than a wood palette (pale, cool, dry),
    per the de-wood fix.

    **Fix (round 1: controller render read as polished wood, not
    sandstone).** The first pass's fine high-frequency bands + saturated
    warm-brown palette + glossy mid roughness, once smeared by
    `directional_warp`, read exactly like continuous wood grain. Fixed by:
    (1) matte roughness -- see below; (2) a fine `GritNoise` perlin
    multiplied subtly over the albedo (see below) so the surface reads as
    gritty stone, not smooth grain; (3) a paler/cooler/desaturated palette;
    (4) chunkier bands (`scale_y` dropped 16->9) so the base had broad
    bands for the warp to smear, not fine continuous lines.

    **Fix (round 2: controller render read as travertine/limestone mottle,
    strata washed out).** Pulling the banding down in round 1 overcorrected
    -- the sediment layers stopped reading as distinct strata at all. Fixed
    by (1) raising `SedimentNoise.scale_y` back up (9 -> 14, more/thinner
    bands) while keeping `scale_x` low (still 4, stretched horizontal
    bands); (2) replacing `SedimentBands`' smooth 6-stop ramp with the
    10-stop hard-plateau gradient above, so individual layers are visible as
    distinct color bands rather than a soft gradient; (3) trimming
    `ErosionWarp.strength` 0.62 -> 0.5 so the now-thinner, higher-contrast
    layers get smeared into legible erosion runs rather than dissolved back
    into a mottle. The matte roughness, grit, and pale/cool palette from
    round 1 are all kept unchanged.

    **Fix (round 3: controller read the band edges as too hard-edged /
    posterized, like topographic contour lines).** Round 2's 10-stop
    gradient joined its five color plateaus with hard ~0.02-wide cuts,
    which read as crisp, almost cartographic steps rather than natural
    geology. Softened by widening each of the four transition zones from
    ~0.02 to ~0.08 (the four paired near-coincident stops moved apart:
    0.19/0.21 -> 0.16/0.24, 0.40/0.42 -> 0.37/0.45, 0.61/0.63 -> 0.58/0.66,
    0.82/0.84 -> 0.79/0.87), so each layer now fades gradually into the
    next instead of stepping. All 5 colors, their order, and their
    approximate plateau centers are unchanged; only the transition width
    moved, trading round 2's "5 flat plateaus / hard cuts" look for
    "5 distinct layers / soft edges" -- still clearly banded, not washed
    back into round 1's smooth mottle. `SedimentNoise.scale_y`,
    `ErosionWarp.strength`/`angle`, the matte roughness, and the grit are
    all unchanged from round 2.

    **Directional erosion.** `ErosionWarp` (`directional_warp`) takes
    `SedimentBands`' RGBA output directly on its `in#` port (port 0) --
    proven valid by `dry_earth`'s own `warp_0`, which reads an RGBA colorize
    the same way. `anglemap`/`strengthmap` (ports 1/2) are left unconnected
    so the node uses its own constant defaults, giving a clean, repeatable
    displacement from `angle`/`strength` alone (per `describe_node` and the
    task brief). `angle=-58` (a steep diagonal, not the swatch's horizontal
    0) and `strength=0.5` (moderate -- trimmed from round 1's 0.62 per the
    round-2 fix above) smear the horizontal bands into diagonal streaks --
    the strata read as if water ran down the face and dragged the layers
    with it, smeared but still legible as layers, not erased.

    **Relief and roughness both read the eroded field, not the pre-warp
    one** -- `ErosionWarp`'s output feeds both `ReliefHeight` (a plain 0->1
    ramp) and `SandstoneRoughness` (a narrow MATTE band, 0.80-0.88 -- raised
    substantially from the first pass's 0.52-0.70 glossy-leaning band, which
    was a big part of the wood-sheen misread; sandstone is not glossy), the
    same "RGBA warp output straight into an f-typed `colorize` input"
    pattern `dry_earth` uses for `warp_0 -> colorize_4`. So the bump map and
    the roughness variation both carry the erosion streaks, not just the
    albedo -- a stone face that has been eroded reads that erosion in its
    surface relief and finish, not only its color. `SandstoneNormal`
    (`normal_map`) keeps `param4=0` (the project's standing flat-normal fix
    for a directly-fed analytic source) with a moderate `param1=0.3` --
    gentle relief, not a deep bulge; this is a worn stone face, not chunky
    cobbles. Non-metal: `Material.metallic` is set to 0 as a plain scalar
    (port 1 left unconnected), the same convention
    `_from_scratch_noise_material` and `s11_marble`'s roughness use when no
    texture is wired to a port -- the scalar applies directly.

    **Surface grit.** `GritNoise` is a fine perlin (`scale_x=42`,
    `scale_y=42`, 5 iterations -- the same fine-grain idiom `s05`/`s06`/
    `s07`/`s08`/`s10` already use in this file for per-stone surface grain),
    `GritContrast` colorizes it to a narrow, subtle multiply band
    (0.88-1.0), and `AlbedoGrit` (`blend`, `blend_type=2` Multiply,
    `amount=1`, port 2 mask left unconnected so the opacity defaults to a
    uniform 1.0 -- no threshold/speckle risk) multiplies it over
    `ErosionWarp`'s eroded albedo before `Material` port 0. Continuous smooth
    grain reads as wood; a fine gritty micro-texture reads as stone, so this
    is the second (with the matte roughness) biggest lever against the wood
    misread.

    **How this differs from the rest of the stone category.** Every other
    stone recipe differentiates through a spatial CELL pattern (voronoi
    plates/cracks for s07/s08/s10/s11, a hex grid for s05, Bricks courses
    for s09) or per-cell/per-fleck random color (s02, s04, s06). This one has
    no cells at all -- its structure is a directional smear of horizontal
    layers, the one distortion technique (`directional_warp`) nothing else
    in the cookbook uses. That keeps it visually and structurally distinct
    rather than reading as another rocky-blob variant."""
