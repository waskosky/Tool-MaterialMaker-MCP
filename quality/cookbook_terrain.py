    First attempt moved the mask threshold DOWN (0.22, by analogy with how

    """Rippled wet sand: the first cookbook material to use `wavelet_noise`
    (zero prior use anywhere in the cookbook per the 2026-09-01 noise-vocab
    audit -- `noise_gallery.py`'s own `wavelet_banded` swatch is the only
    place this node had appeared before). Built from scratch via
    `_from_scratch_noise_material` (no donor has this topology) then
    `retype()`d from its placeholder `perlin_0` to `wavelet_noise`, the same
    move `t07_forest_floor` uses to swap in `fbm` -- output port 0 is a
    plain `f` scalar on both node types, so the swap is connection-safe.

    RETUNE (round 3, controller self-screen): round 2 locked in the correct
    ripple STRUCTURE (anisotropic scale 2/24, `type=4` = "Mult 3", `iterations=2`, the
    ripple->normal relief -- all left untouched here) but overcorrected the
    palette all the way to a flat neutral grey, reading as brushed metal or
    stone rather than sand. Palette-only fix: `WetSandColor`'s gradient
    shifted warm again -- a muted warm khaki/tan (more red+green than blue)
    -- while keeping round 2's mid-tone luminance (still ~0.35-0.5 average,
    not round 1's dark ~0.2). Landed between the two prior attempts: warmer
    (higher saturation, clear R>G>B warmth) than round 2's grey, lighter and
    less saturated than round 1's dark chocolate-brown. Nothing else in
    this builder changed for round 3 -- see the round-2 note below for the
    ripple-structure reasoning, which is now locked.

    RETUNE (round 2, controller self-screen at 512): round 1 used isotropic
    `scale_x == scale_y` and read as a dark, dense, muddy mottle -- no
    banding at all, and too dark/chocolate-brown for wet sand. Two root
    causes, both fixed here:

    1. Isotropic scale can't produce bands. Reading `wavelet_noise.mmg`'s
       actual GLSL (`z-Git/material-maker/addons/material_maker/nodes/
       wavelet_noise.mmg`): `size = vec2(scale_x, scale_y)` tiles the field
       per-axis independently, so equal scale tiles equally in both
       directions -> isotropic blobs, never bands, no matter what `type` or
       `iterations` is. Fixed with STRONG anisotropy: `scale_x=2` (few
       tiles -> the field barely varies along x, so each feature stretches
       long across it) and `scale_y=24` (many tiles -> tight repetition
       along y), producing elongated near-parallel streaks running along x,
       stacked along y -- the near-parallel-ripple-band look wet sand
       actually has, distinct from `t01_sand_dunes`' broad ISOTROPIC-ish
       perlin rolls (which vary smoothly in both axes, never band) and from
       every voronoi-plate sibling (cellular, not banded, at all).
    2. `type` must be the enum INDEX, not the option's underlying value.
       Material Maker stores an enum parameter as the ordinal index into the
       option list; at shader-gen time it substitutes `values[index].value`
       into `$type`, clamping any index < 0 or >= len to 0 (see
       `z-Git/material-maker/addons/material_maker/engine/nodes/gen_shader.gd`
       lines 527-529). The options are Add 1/2/3 (underlying values
       `1`/`2`/`3`, indices 0/1/2) and Mult 2/3 (underlying values `-2`/`-3`,
       indices 3/4). The shader does `if (type > 0.0) { ... additive domain
       shift ... } else { local_uv *= -type; size *= -type; ... }`, so the
       Mult branch multiplies the domain each octave, which is where the
       sharp interference-fringe character comes from. "Mult 3" is therefore
       INDEX 4: storing `4` makes MM substitute `values[4].value` = `-3`
       into the shader (the Mult branch) for the sharpest fringes -- so the
       catalog's 0-4 index range is CORRECT and `validate_graph` passes with
       no warning. (History: round 1 used the right index `4`; a round-2
       detour changed it to the literal `-3` believing that was "Mult 3",
       but `-3 < 0` clamps to index 0 = "Add 1", a silent wrong render.
       Reverted to `4` on 2026-09-13.) Also kept `iterations` at 2 (round 1
       used 3; fewer octaves -> cleaner, less busy bands), `frequency` 1.6
       (pairs with the Mult type for tighter interference fringes) and
       `persistence`/`offset` at 0.5/0.

    Palette also lightened and cooled per the round-2 brief: wet sand is a
    damp mid-tone khaki/tan (round 1 was too dark and too saturated warm-
    brown, reading as mud/coffee grounds). New gradient averages ~0.35-0.48
    luminance with a narrow, mostly-grey R/G/B spread (khaki, not chocolate
    brown) -- see `WetSandColor` below.

    Distinct from `t01_sand_dunes` (broad, organic, wood-donor perlin rolls,
    warm tan, high roughness) on every axis: tight anisotropic bands
    instead of broad isotropic rolls, a cooler/greyer damp khaki instead of
    warm tan, and LOW roughness for a wet sheen instead of dune's high matte
    roughness. Not based on any voronoi-plate/`dry_earth` donor, so it does
    not add to that already-overused family either.

    Roughness is fed as a flat texture (`rough_const`) rather than left as
    a Material-node scalar only -- the same lesson `_dry_earth_plates` and
    `p01_glossy_plastic` (`cookbook_plastics.py`) already established -- so
    an ORM map exports for the wet-sheen preview instead of silently having
    none. This, the low-roughness wet sheen, and feeding the ripple field
    into the normal for corrugation are all unchanged from round 1 -- the
    round-2 brief flagged only the base-field anisotropy/type and the
    palette."""

    """Packed dirt: the first cookbook material to use `dirt`, a compound

    one of three composite sub-networks, "Dirt 1"/"Dirt 2"/"Dirt 3", each
    blending a hexagonal `shape` field with `fbm2` noise through a tiler --
    read from `dirt.mmg`'s own `gen_parameters` block). Built from scratch
    via `_from_scratch_noise_material` (no donor has this topology), then
    `retype()`d from the placeholder `perlin_0` to `dirt` -- the same
    connection-safe swap `t07_forest_floor`/`t09_rippled_wet_sand` already
    use, since a compound node's port 0 is a plain `f` output like `perlin`'s.

    VERIFICATION (isolated single-node renders via the MCP
    `render_node_output` tool, all three `param0` modes rendered and
    compared at `d_scale=1`, `param1=11` -- the node's own defaults -- since
    the brief flagged mode 0 as a real risk of reading too
    regular/hexagonal): none of the three modes show a visible hexagonal
    grid (the `shape` field is evidently randomized enough by the fbm2/tiler
    math that the hex tiling never surfaces), so that specific risk did not
    materialize. But they are NOT equivalent, and mode 0 does have its own
    "too regular" problem the brief anticipated in different words:

    - `param0=0` ("Dirt 1"): a dense scatter of small, mostly CIRCULAR,
      individually distinct soft-edged dots/blobs of varying size -- reads
      as a granular speckle/spatter, not as merged patches. Regular in
      SHAPE (each blob is a soft circle) even though scattered irregularly
      in position.
    - `param0=1` ("Dirt 2"): much finer and closer to uniform static/grain
      -- soft blobs are still present but smaller and more overlapping,
      with almost no larger-scale clustering visible even at a
      384px-downsampled "typical viewing distance" check.
    - `param0=2` ("Dirt 3"): visibly larger, elongated, IRREGULAR blotches
      with soft, feathered edges that merge into loose connected patches
      rather than staying as discrete dots -- the only one of the three
      that actually reads as "irregular soft-edged blotchy patches" rather
      than a dot-scatter or fine grain.

    Chosen: `param0=2`. `d_scale` (range 1-8) only makes the pattern FINER
    as it increases (it raises the tiler's tile count), so `d_scale=1`
    (the node's own default) is already the largest-patch setting available
    -- there is no larger-scale option to reach for.

    A follow-up check (per the project's pinned lesson: verify a channel by
    reading its actual pixel values, not by eye) measured the grayscale
    histogram of the chosen mode-2 render with a scratch numpy/PIL script:
    mean 0.22, median (p50) 0.20, p95 0.49, p99 0.63, max 1.0 -- the `dirt`
    output sits mostly in the bottom third of the 0..1 range, with only a
    thin tail of pixels reaching higher values. A first-draft gradient with
    naive stops at pos 0.0/0.5/1.0 would put the mid and light colors past
    where the data actually lives, so the material would have rendered as
    near-uniformly dark and never shown its documented tan highlight --
    the same docstring-vs-pixels trap the sibling task hit, one step
    removed (verifying the node's grayscale output is not the same as
    verifying what the colorize gradient does with it). The gradient below
    is remapped so its stops sit where the measured percentiles actually
    are (dark tone at the median ~0.20, mid tan at ~0.49 = p95, light
    highlight reached only near the true max) rather than at naive evenly
    spaced positions.

    Muted brown/tan packed-earth palette (dark shadowed dirt, its darkest
    stop reached only in rare near-black crevices, through the
    percentile-matched dominant dark-brown median tone, to a lighter
    dry-dirt highlight reached only by the brightest fleck pixels), HIGH
    matte roughness (0.88) for bare uncoated earth -- the deliberate
    opposite of `t09_rippled_wet_sand`'s 0.15 wet sheen in the same file.
    `normal_map param1=0.3` for a moderate, worn unevenness -- `dirt` has no
    crack network to begin with, so this relief reads as rolling, worn
    ground rather than sharp fissures. `param4=0` on the normal chain per the project's
    standing flat-normal-source fix. Roughness fed as a flat texture
    (`rough_const`), immune to this same input-range trap since a flat
    gradient returns the same color regardless of input value, rather than
    left as a Material-node scalar only -- the same `_dry_earth_plates`/
