"""Cookbook growth: painted-metal category authoring recipes beyond the frozen
15-case Phase 3 test set. Additive, not an edit to the frozen metals
(`m01`/`m02`/`m03` live in docs/evidence/phase3/test_set.json). Informal: 1 variant per
material, no scorecard gate. Reuses author_helpers.py's graph-surgery helpers; outputs
land under quality/authored/cookbook-painted-metal/<case>/v1.ptex.

The whole family is surface-finish, which risks five gray panels that differ
only in gloss. Each material is built around a distinct STRUCTURAL read, not
just a roughness number:
  pm01 powder coat  -> fine dense orange-peel micro-bumps, matte
  pm02 auto enamel  -> near-mirror flat, faint per-cell fleck
  pm03 chipped      -> the chip mask IS the structure; chips expose BARE metal
  pm04 hammertone   -> medium rounded dimple field (strongest structural read)
  pm05 scuffed      -> directional brushed scuffing with a clear horizontal axis

Two PBR-correctness rules baked in throughout:
  1. Metallic is a dielectric-vs-metal DECISION, never global. Paint => 0;
     only pm03's exposed bare metal is metallic 1, driven by the chip mask.
     A globally-metallic painted panel renders near-black in the preview scene.
  2. Every chip/wear mask fed to a `blend`'s port 2 is a HARD 0/1 step, never a
     mid-value albedo colorize -- a blend's opacity is `amount * port2`, so a
     mid-value mask makes the top layer semi-transparent (the sf03 bug). See
     docs/AUTHORING.md.

Normal-map note: rock/wood donors feed their normal from a directly-fed
analytic generator, so `normal_map_0.param4` must be 0 (raw edge_detect) for
real relief; the default 1 (buffered) renders flat. See f01/s02 in author.py.

Run: python -m quality.cookbook_painted_metal
Then `python -m quality.render_one` cookbook-painted-metal <case> renders one for review.

    albedo with per-cell tonal variation so dimples catch the light; metallic 0
    (it is paint), semi-gloss roughness for the metallic-looking sheen.

    2026-09-14 normal/albedo alignment fix -- the OTHER direction from the
    stone/gravel fixes, because here the NORMAL (the hammer dimples) is the
    hero and must stay deep. Rock's donor drives the albedo colorize off
    voronoi_0/blend_0 but the relief off a SEPARATE voronoi_1 (warped by
    perlin_1), so the bronze mottling used to sit on an unrelated cell field,
    not in the dimples. Fix: feed colorize_0 (albedo) from warp_0's output --
    the EXACT warped height field that also drives normal_map_0 -- so the dark
    pit / lit crest tones land precisely in the dimples. voronoi_0/blend_0 go
    dead-for-output (the same harmless dead-end pm02 already carries; perlin_0
    still drives roughness/metallic, so it stays live). The dimple depth
    (param1=0.42) is untouched. Look note: albedo mottling is now strictly
    dimple-locked; the incidental voronoi_0 tonal variation is gone from
    albedo (roughness variation from perlin_0 survives)."""

def build_pm06_splatter_finish(catalog: dict) -> str:
    """Industrial spray-splatter finish: a dark charcoal base coat with light
    cream paint flecks, the first cookbook material to use `splatter`
    (zero prior use anywhere in the cookbook). Distinct from every other
    painted-metal material in this file (`pm01` orange-peel, `pm02` mirror
    enamel, `pm03` paint-chip-to-bare-metal, `pm04` hammer dimples, `pm05`
    directional scuffs) -- this is the only one built from discrete,
    individually placed/scaled/tinted splat instances rather than a
    continuous noise field.

    `splatter` is NOT a bare generator: its `in` port has a literal `"0.0"`
    shader default, so an unconnected `in` renders as a flat blank field
    (verified via `describe_node`). Built from scratch via
    `_from_scratch_noise_material` (no donor has this topology), then the
    placeholder `perlin_0` is `retype()`d to `shape` (a Circle) instead of
    the true target, and a `splatter_0` node is inserted between it and the
    skeleton's albedo/normal chain -- the same "retype the placeholder,
    then splice a real node after it" move `t09_rippled_wet_sand` uses for
    `wavelet_noise`, just with an extra node in the chain since `splatter`
    needs a real pattern feeding its `in` port rather than being a bare
    generator itself.

    Wiring, in order:
      1. `retype(g, "perlin_0", "shape", {...})` -- perlin_0 keeps its name,
         now outputs a soft-edged circle field.
      2. `add_node(g, "splatter_0", "splatter", {...})`.
      3. `perlin_0:0 -> splatter_0:0` (feeds the circle into splatter's
         `in`, input index 0). `mask` (input index 1) is left unconnected;
         its literal `"1.0"` default means "splatter everywhere," correct
         for a panel with no masked region.
      4. `rewire(g, "colorize_0", 0, "splatter_0", 0)` and
         `rewire(g, "normal_map_0", 0, "splatter_0", 0)` -- repoint the
         skeleton's downstream albedo/normal chain from the shape onto the
         splatter output.

    DEVIATION from the task brief's literal shape params, found by the
    verification render below and worth flagging explicitly: the brief's
    suggested `{"shape": 0, "radius": 1, "edge": 0.2}` (shape's own bare
    catalog defaults) renders as 3-4 giant circles that each fill nearly
    the whole tile and overlap into indistinct blobs -- `splatter` treats
    its ENTIRE input field as one splat instance and places copies of that
    whole field at random per-instance offsets (traced in
    `splatter.mmg`'s shader: `pv = fract(uv - seed) - 0.5`), so a
    tile-filling circle can never read as a small discrete droplet no
    matter how `splatter`'s own count/scale/value are tuned. Shrunk to
    `radius=0.12, edge=0.3` (small circle, soft wide edge) so each placed
    instance reads as one paint droplet with visible gaps between them.
    `splatter_0`'s own params are exactly the brief's recipe, pushed up
    from splatter's bare defaults (`count=10, rotate=0, scale=0, value=0.5,
    variations=false`) so each instance gets randomized scale and
    brightness: `count=24` (enough droplets to read as a finish, not a few
    stray specks), `scale=0.4` (RndScale, up to +-40% per-instance size
    variation, clearly visible in the render as small/large droplet mix),
    `value=0.6` (RndValue, per-instance darkening up to 60%, giving the
    tonal variation seen below), `variations=True` (so `variations` also
    randomizes which part of the shape field each instance samples, not
    just its transform). `rotate=180` is carried over from the brief's
    recipe but is cosmetically INERT here -- a Circle is rotationally
    symmetric, so `splatter`'s RndRotate has no visible effect on this
    particular shape; kept anyway since the brief specifies it and it
    costs nothing (a future non-circular splat shape would make it visible).

    VERIFICATION (honest, two isolated-render passes plus one full-graph
    render, all via MCP tools, all pixels actually inspected, not
    described from expectation):
      - First pass at the brief's literal `radius=1, edge=0.2`: rendered
        `splatter_0` in isolation (`render_node_output`) and saw exactly
        the failure mode above -- 3-4 huge overlapping pale-grey circles
        covering nearly the entire 512x512 frame, no gaps, no readable
        individual droplets. Not the blank-field failure (input WAS
        connected) but a distinct "splats too large to read as discrete"
        failure the brief anticipated in general terms ("adjust
        count/rotate/scale/value... if it looks wrong").
      - Second pass at `radius=0.12, edge=0.3`: re-rendered `splatter_0` in
        isolation. Result: a scatter of ~20-25 soft-edged circular splats
        of clearly varying size (RndScale) and clearly varying grayscale
        brightness (RndValue, from near-white to mid-grey), on a solid
        black background, with visible gaps between most splats and only
        occasional overlap where two instances happen to land close
        together. This is the target look -- randomly placed, randomly
        scaled, randomly toned discrete circular splats, neither blank nor
        a regular untransformed grid.
      - Measured the raw grayscale output with `quality/pngread.py`
        (project convention: verify a channel by reading its pixel values,
        not by eye) before choosing the albedo gradient: background (value
        0) is 71.8% of pixels; the splat body only becomes substantial
        above roughly the 80th percentile (p80=0.35, p85=0.47, p90=0.58,
        p95=0.73, p99=0.80, max=0.96). So `SplatterColor`'s gradient below
        holds the dark base coat flat through pos 0.32 (covering the
        background plus the soft antialiased onset of a splat edge), then
        ramps to the full cream splatter tone by pos 0.55 (just below the
        measured p90), with the brightest cream reached only near pos 1.0
        (the rare near-max pixels at splat centers) -- stops chosen against
        the measured distribution, not evenly spaced guesses.
      - Rendered the complete small graph (`render_graph`, full
        perlin_0->splatter_0->colorize_0/normal_map_0/rough_const->Material
        chain) and inspected the actual albedo and normal outputs. Albedo:
        a genuine two-tone industrial spatter finish, dark charcoal base
        with light cream flecks of clearly varying size and tone, no blank
        field, no regular grid -- matches the isolated-render read above.
        Normal: `normal_map`'s `param4=0` (raw edge_detect, the project's
        standing flat-normal-source fix) turns each splat's EDGE into a
        thin raised-rim highlight with a flat interior and flat
        background, not a smooth domed bump -- an honest "thin build-up"
        read (paint sitting slightly proud at each droplet's perimeter),
        distinct from a modeled 3D droplet but consistent with how every
        other edge_detect-sourced normal in this project reads (crack
        rims, scuff ridges), so described here as a raised-rim relief, not
        a dome.

    Semi-gloss roughness (flat 0.38, between `pm01`'s matte 0.62-0.72 and
    `pm02`'s near-mirror 0.07-0.11) via a flat `rough_const` texture so an
    ORM map exports, same pattern as `t09`/`p01`. `metallic=0.0` throughout
    (a painted finish over metal, not bare metal, matching the
    metallic-is-a-decision convention every other material in this file
    follows). `normal_map_0.param1=0.18` for the thin raised-rim relief
    described above -- shallower than `pm04`'s 0.42 hammer dimples, in the
    same range as `pm01`'s 0.12 orange-peel skin."""
