def build_w03_painted_wood_siding(catalog: dict) -> str:
    """Painted plank siding, paint worn off in patches to reveal the boards.
    CLONE `wooden_floor` (NOT `wood`), because siding needs visible BOARD
    STRUCTURE to read as siding at all -- wooden_floor's `bricks_0` (10 rows,
    1 column) gives horizontal planks with mortar-line gaps, and its
    `blend_0` output already carries plank albedo + relief. Then composite a
    weathered off-white paint coat over `blend_0` through an irregular
    perlin-threshold mask (same masked-composite lever as
    combo01_rusted_painted_steel), so where paint is worn the real boards
    show through. The plank normal from wooden_floor is left untouched, so
    the board seams stay physically present under both paint and bare wood.

    History (three donors, this is the fourth pass): the first three versions
    cloned `wood` (pure vertical grain, NO board structure) and read as
    abstract cow-hide / paint-splatter blobs no matter how the mask was
    tuned, because nothing in `wood` says "boards." (Along the way, a
    razor-thin mask threshold + a stark white-vs-dark-grain palette also
    produced visible `blend`-edge speckle -- see the s05/`blend` opacity
    note in AUTHORING.md; widening the band fixed that but not the
    doesn't-read-as-siding problem.) Grayson flagged the wood-donor version
    as "something's not quite right." The real fix was the DONOR, not the
    mask: on a planked base it reads as painted siding immediately. Paint
    kept a warm off-white (not pure white, which looked like missing
    texture) and the exposed wood warmed up so the worn boards read as
    natural timber."""

    """Burled wood: rich walnut-burl palette, broad SWIRLING/knotted figure
    instead of the straight parallel grain w04/w05's unmodified `wood` chain
    already produces. Clones `wood` (same donor as w04/w05) and retypes
    `warp_1` -- the donor's SECOND warp in the `wood_grain` chain, which in
    the unmodified donor distorts the grain field by a thresholded voronoi
    ring pattern (`RingWarp`, growth-ring/cathedral figure) -- to `warp2`.

    `warp2` is a Distortion-vocabulary Transform node (MM's own `tree_item`
    taxonomy: "warp" -> "Transform/Warp"), NOT one of the noise/pattern
    generator nodes `quality/node_usage_audit.py`'s `_NOISE_PATTERN_NODES`
    list counts -- so this material does not move that script's coverage
    numbers, unlike every other material this round. Noted here so a future
    reader checking the audit for `warp2` usage does not conclude it is
    unused.

    The donor's `voronoi_0` -> `colorize_1` ring-pattern chain (the
    displacement `warp_1` used before this edit) is deleted outright rather
    than folded into a subgraph as `*Unused`, the way w03's inherited
    `combine_0` and the cookbook's other donor-dead-code cases are handled
    (that remains the dominant convention here, see e.g. `cookbook_metal.py`,
    `cookbook_painted_metal.py`, `cookbook_stone.py`). This builder's case is
    a local deviation, not a rule: the pair becomes dead code only because of
    this specific edit (it did not arrive dead with the donor), so deleting
    it felt like the more honest choice for this one node pair, not a
    project-wide policy that dead code introduced by an edit must always be
    deleted. In its place, a new low-frequency `perlin`
    (`perlin_3`, scale_x=scale_y=2 -- roughly isotropic and an order of
    magnitude coarser than `GrainNoiseFine`'s scale_x=32) feeds `warp2`'s
    port-1 displacement input, producing broad, roughly circular swirls
    instead of voronoi's cell-boundary rings.

    `warp2`'s `amount` (verified range 0..1 via describe_node, unlike
    `warp`'s unbounded `amount` -- `debug_swatches.py::build_swatch_warp2`'s
    0.3 is well below `warp`'s own 1.0-amount swatch) is pushed to 0.65: high
    enough that the swirl dominates the underlying grain (a lower value
    tested during iteration read as only a subtle wobble, closer to
    `warp_0`'s existing wave than a distinct burl figure), but short of the
    0.9-1.0 range where the field started folding into illegible noise.

    Palette: richer contrast than w05's dark walnut, with a near-black
    "burl eye" low point and a warm honey-brown high point so the swirl
    pattern itself reads as figure, not just a recolor. Same semi-gloss
