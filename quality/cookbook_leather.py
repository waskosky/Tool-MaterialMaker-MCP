"""Cookbook growth: leather-category authoring recipes beyond the frozen 15-case
Phase 3 test set (`f02_brown_leather` is frozen there already -- see
docs/evidence/phase3/test_set.json's freeze note; this is additive, not an edit to that
case). Informal: 1 variant per material, no scorecard gate. Reuses author_helpers.py's
graph-surgery helpers; outputs land under
quality/authored/cookbook-leather/<case>/v1.ptex, same layout convention as the
Phase 3 iterations.

All four clone `crocodile_skin` -- the proven leather donor whose cellular
voronoi grain drives albedo (colorize_1 -> Material.albedo), roughness
(colorize_3 -> Material.roughness) and a height chain (colorize_0 ->
normal_map_0 -> Material.normal). f02 established the recolor lever on it; these
push into distinct territory: a glossy dark finish, a masked two-tone worn
composite, a soft napped suede (perlin donor, no cell grid), and a bold exotic
reptile scale. Where a variant wants real grain relief, it applies the
`param4=0` normal_map fix (see AUTHORING.md) -- f02 predates that fix and
renders a flat normal.

Run: python -m quality.cookbook_leather
Then `python -m quality.render_cookbook` cookbook-leather renders each for inspection.

    across the surface instead of the sharp cellular scale edges every other
    crocodile_skin clone uses. Donor-swap lever, same shape as l03's
    voronoi_0 -> perlin retype, but here voronoi_0 -> `fbm` with `noise=2`
    (Cellular 1, "worley cells, dark centers" per AUTHORING.md's noise
    vocabulary table): a multi-octave worley basis whose cell interiors read
    soft and rounded rather than voronoi's hard polygon edges, closer to a
    pebbled/Saffiano grain than l04's bold scaled reptile look.

    Polarity check (not assumed): rendered the existing
    quality/cookbook/noise-gallery/fbm_2_cellular1 swatch (fbm noise=2,
    scale 4, iterations=3, persistence=0.5, straight 0-black/1-white ramp)
    and inspected it directly. The dark-blob-at-cell-center character
    documented in AUTHORING.md survives fbm's 3-octave sum -- port 0 is
    still LOW at cell centers and HIGH at the borders between them, the same
    polarity `_dome_the_cells` assumes for voronoi_0. So the height ramp is
    reused unmodified: centers (low) dome UP into small pebble bumps, the
    network between them (high) recedes -- the correct read for pebbled
    leather (rounded bumps), not the pore-as-hole reading the raw "pores"
    language might suggest.

    scale_x/scale_y raised from the noise-gallery swatch's coarse scale 4
    (a handful of huge blobs, meant to keep one basis legible per swatch
    tile) to 20 -- close to crocodile_skin's own donor default voronoi scale
    (16), for a dense small-pebble grain rather than a few giant lumps.

    value), darker wine shade in the recessed network between them (high
